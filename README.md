# Landscape Estimator 🌍🤖

**AI-powered land area estimates.**

## 🚀 What is this?

Landscape Estimator is a tool that uses **AI, GIS data, and aerial imagery** to estimate land areas for landscaping and property management. It combines:  
✅ **Public GIS data** for property sizes  
✅ **Aerial analysis** for estimating lawn areas  
✅ **User-assisted polygon tracing** for corrections  
✅ **Next.js + TypeScript** for modern web performance

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Enter an Address** → We pull public land area data.
2. **AI Analyzes Aerial Data** → If data is missing, we estimate from images.
3. **User Refines the Estimate** → Adjust land area with a simple UI.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript
- **Backend:** GIS APIs, AI/ML models (TBD)
- **Mapping:** Google Maps API / Leaflet.js
