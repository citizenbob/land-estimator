## Decision Matrix Scoring

Run the performance tests first, then score each experiment 1-5 for each criteria.

**Final Score = (Performance × 0.3) + (Cost × 0.2) + (Complexity × 0.2) + (Reliability × 0.15) + (Scalability × 0.1) + (Security × 0.05)**

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run performance comparison test
2. ⬜ Complete cost analysis
3. ⬜ Test failure scenarios
4. ⬜ Validate with real production data size
5. ⬜ Make final recommendation
